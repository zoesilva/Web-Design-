            <h2>A website, at its core, is described as a file or bundle of files residing on a server accessible via the internet. It is essentially a digital space created using markup and code languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires a server to host it and a domain name to access it. Links, connecting various web pages, are fundamental elements of websites.
            </h2>
            <h3>Why put things on the internet?
            </h3>
            <h4>By having a website, individuals can contribute to an interconnected network, enriching it with diverse perspectives and content. Additionally, websites serve as platforms for self-expression, sharing ideas, and creating digital spaces reflective of one's identity and aspirations. The internet serves as a digital archive, preserving information and cultural artifacts for future generations. By putting things on the internet, individuals and organizations contribute to the collective memory and history of the digital age. For businesses, organizations, and individuals looking to promote products, services, or events, the internet offers powerful marketing and promotional opportunities. Websites, social media, email marketing, and online advertising are all effective tools for reaching and engaging with target audiences.</h4>
            <h5>Will websites someday become obsolete?
            </h5>
            <h6>In Laurel Schwulst's essay “My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be?” she hints at the dynamic nature of the internet and the continuous evolution of digital platforms. Websites are portrayed as living, temporal spaces that can adapt and change over time. Therefore, while the specific form and function of websites may evolve, the concept of digital presence and self-expression on the internet is likely to persist.</h6>
            <h3>What is my relationship with technology?</h3>
            <h2>In many ways, technology is an integral part of my life. From the moment I wake up to the sound of my smartphone alarm, to the late-night study sessions on my laptop, technology facilitates nearly every aspect of my existence. It's how I communicate with friends and family, access information for my classes, and even unwind with entertainment during my downtime. 

                However, amidst the convenience and connectivity that technology offers, I've also become increasingly aware of its drawbacks and pitfalls. The constant stream of social media updates can sometimes feel overwhelming, leading to feelings of comparison, inadequacy, and FOMO (fear of missing out). I catch myself mindlessly scrolling through Instagram or TikTok, only to emerge hours later feeling drained and unfulfilled.
                
                Moreover, I've noticed how technology has the power to both unite and isolate us. While platforms like Zoom and FaceTime allow me to stay connected with loved ones, especially during these uncertain times, they can never fully replicate the warmth and intimacy of face-to-face interaction. I sometimes worry that our reliance on digital communication may be eroding the depth and authenticity of our relationships.
                
                Yet, despite these concerns, I can't deny the immense opportunities and possibilities that technology affords us. It's through technology that I've been able to pursue my passions, whether it's discovering new music on Spotify, exploring different cultures through YouTube travel vlogs, or even expressing myself creatively through digital art.
                
                Ultimately, I believe that my relationship with technology is a complex and multifaceted one, characterized by both dependence and ambivalence. As I navigate through college and adulthood in this digital age, I strive to strike a balance between harnessing the benefits of technology while remaining mindful of its potential pitfalls. After all, technology is a tool—a powerful one at that—and it's up to us to wield it responsibly and intentionally in order to enrich our lives and cultivate meaningful connections in an increasingly interconnected world.
