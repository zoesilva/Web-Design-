    <h3>Class Reflection</h3>    
<h4>Reflecting on this web design class, I've come to appreciate the skills we've covered and how they can contribute to my growth as a creative individual. I initially saw web design as a technical skill, but now I understand its artistic aspects and how it blends technology with visual culture. 

<br><br>I'm mostly satisfied with the work I produced during the course. While there were definitely challenges, I feel like I've grown significantly in my ability to create visually appealing and functional websites. However, there's always room for improvement, and I'm excited to continue honing my skills. 

<br><br>This class has definitely changed my views on art, technology, and visual culture. I used to see them as separate entities, but now I understand how they intersect and influence each other. Website design is art, after all. 

<br><br>As for the future, I do plan on using my web design skills. Whether it's for personal projects or professional endeavors, I believe these skills will be valuable in a variety of contexts. However, I also recognize that coding websites may not be my primary focus.
