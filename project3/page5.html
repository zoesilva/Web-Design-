        <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway.

            <br><br> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, this time she found a little bottle on it, and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words <i>'DRINK ME'</i> beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
