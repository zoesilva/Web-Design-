            <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. Away went Alice like the wind. She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall.

<br><br>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fit!
