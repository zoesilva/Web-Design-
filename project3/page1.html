            <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
                
                <br> <br> There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <i>`Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'</i><br><br>But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
