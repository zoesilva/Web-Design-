        <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. She looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled <span>'ORANGE MARMALADE'</span>, but to her great disappointment it was empty. 
                    
            
            <br> <br> Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! <i>'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?'</i> she said aloud. 
            
            
            <br> <br> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much tonight, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
